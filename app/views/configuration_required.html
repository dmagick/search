<h2>Some configuration is required</h2>
It seems you're using this for the first time, a couple of things need to be done before it will be up and running.<br/>
Create a directory and make sure the web server can write to it: cache/<br/>
Create a file: app/config.php<br/>
It should contain the following:<br/>
&lt;?php<br/>
$config = array(<br/>
'flickrApiKey' => '....',<br/>
);<br/>
